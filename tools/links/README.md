Drop-on-demand deposition of water onto a −35 °C platform rapidly transforms water into ice. The dimension and geometry of the structures are critically controlled by droplet ejection frequency modulation and stage motions. The freeform approach obviates layer-by-layer construction and support structures, even for overhang geometries. Complex and overhang geometries, branched hierarchical structures with smooth transitions, circular cross-sections, smooth surfaces, and micro-scale features (as small as 50 µm) are demonstrated. As a sample application, the ice templates are used as sacrificial geometries to produce resin parts with well-defined internal features. This approach could bring exciting opportunities for microfluidics, biomedical devices, soft electronics, and art.

Currently, only one vaccine is available to prevent severe courses: Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG). However, it is not equally effective against all types of tuberculosis. Especially infants and immunocompromised patients are therefore in urgent need for more effective tuberculosis vaccines. A clinical trial in South Africa has now shown that the new vaccine candidate VPM1002, developed by Max Planck researcher Stefan H.E. Kaufmann and his team, is equally safe for newborns with and without HIV exposure and has fewer side effects compared to BCG."

The authors of the new study aimed to shed light on what happens during the fast temperature changes and find a way to drive the internal structure toward martensite. Just as a high-speed camera is needed to see a hummingbird’s flapping wings, the researchers needed special equipment to observe rapid shifts in structure that occur in milliseconds.

$$ \lambda_{m} = \frac{300}{ \mathit{f}_{MHz} } $$

λ_m = 300 / 𝑓_(MHz)

where:
- \lambda_{m} = wavelength in meters
- 300 = approximate number of (Mm / sec) light travels in a vacuum
- 𝑓_(MHz) = frequency in Mega Hertz

Available from\: " + d.URL + ".";}
```
See also [NIH NLM Cite](#nih-nlm-cite). Easily cite a webpage using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) citation format. [Web Sites - Citing Medicine - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7274/#A59238). You will still need to manually edit Authors, Organization, Date of Publication, Date of Update. TIP: double-click word to select the whole word, then start typing to replace.

javascript:(function(){if(document.designMode=="off"){document.designMode='on'}else{document.designMode="off"}alert("document.designMode='"+document.designMode+"'")})();
```
This JavaScript Bookmarklet code toggles whether the entire document is editable.


### _js-dtdu

### _js-killSticky

```js
javascript:(function(){document.querySelectorAll("body *").forEach(function(node){if(["fixed","sticky"].includes(getComputedStyle(node).position)){node.parentNode.removeChild(node)}});document.querySelectorAll("html *").forEach(function(node){var s=getComputedStyle(node);if("hidden"===s["overflow"]){node.style["overflow"]="visible"}if("hidden"===s["overflow-x"]){node.style["overflow-x"]="visible"}if("hidden"===s["overflow-y"]){node.style["overflow-y"]="visible"}});var htmlNode=document.querySelector("html");htmlNode.style["overflow"]="visible";htmlNode.style["overflow-x"]="visible";htmlNode.style["overflow-y"]="visible"})();
```
This JavaScript Bookmarklet will remove sticky elements and restore scrolling to web pages. [source](https://github.com/t-mart/kill-sticky)

### Medical Devices and Equipment

* [Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/gamma-knife-radiosurgery) - "Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a type of radiotherapy treatment. It’s also called stereotactic radiosurgery. Even though it’s called surgery, a Gamma Knife procedure doesn't use incisions. It also isn’t a knife. Gamma Knife uses very precise beams of gamma rays to treat an area of disease (lesion) or growth (tumor). It’s most often used in the brain. The beams of gamma radiation send a very intense dose of radiation to a small area without a need to make an incision. Radiosurgery destroys cells so that they can’t grow. A lesion or tumor will shrink in size over time."

> DARPA operates on the principle that generating big rewards requires taking big risks. But how does the Agency determine what risks are worth taking?
>
> George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director (1975-1977), crafted a set of questions known as the "Heilmeier Catechism" to help Agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs.
>
> 1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
> 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
> 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
> 4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
> 5. What are the risks?
> 6. How much will it cost?
> 7. How long will it take?
> 8. What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
